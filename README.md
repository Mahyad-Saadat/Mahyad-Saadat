# Mahyad Saadat 
**`Front-End Developer `**

Hi, I'm Mahyad Saadat, a passionate front-end developer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I specialize in building dynamic, responsive user interfaces using React and related technologies. My journey in web development has equipped me with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), and state management tools like Redux.
In addition to my coding skills, I have experience in graphic design, having completed a previous internship in design. This allows me to bring a unique perspective when it comes to creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.! Currently, I'm seeking an internship to further sharpen my skills and collaborate on exciting projects.
